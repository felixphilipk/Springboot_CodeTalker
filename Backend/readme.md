Certainly, here's a README template that includes instructions on how to run the Spring application locally, how to call its endpoints via Postman, and how to handle GitHub OAuth authentication:

# Spring Boot Application - CodeTalker

CodeTalker is a Spring Boot application designed to interface with GitHub repositories, allowing users to fetch dependency information from `pom.xml` files within specified repositories using GitHub's OAuth for secure access.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or later
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for API testing

## Running the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the application directory where the `pom.xml` is located.
3. Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Calling Endpoints via Postman

1. Open Postman.
2. Create a new GET request to `http://localhost:8080/api/dependencies`.
3. Add query parameters:
   - `repoName`: The name of the GitHub repository.
   - `owner`: The GitHub username or organization that owns the repository.

## GitHub OAuth Authentication Flow

To access the GitHub API, the application uses OAuth for authentication. Here's how the flow works:

1. **Request a User's GitHub Identity**:
   - Send a GET request to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize` with the required parameters, including `client_id` and optional `redirect_uri`, `login`, `scope`, `state`, and `allow_signup`.

2. **Users Are Redirected Back to Your Site by GitHub**:
   - If the user accepts the request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary code and the provided state.
   - Exchange this code for an access token by sending a POST request to `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` with `client_id`, `client_secret`, `code`, and optional `redirect_uri`.

3. **Use the Access Token to Access the API**:
   - The access token allows you to make requests to the API on behalf of a user.
   - Set the Authorization header as `Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN` in your API requests.

### Using Postman for GitHub OAuth

In Postman, you can simulate the OAuth flow:

1. **Get the Authorization Code**:
   - Manually navigate to the authorization URL in your web browser or set up an OAuth 2.0 authorization request in Postman with the Auth URL and the necessary parameters.

2. **Get the Access Token**:
   - Use the "

Code" obtained in the previous step to make a POST request in Postman to the token URL with the required parameters (client ID, client secret, and code).

3. **Call the API Using the Access Token**:
   - Set up your GET request in Postman to the endpoint.
   - Under the "Authorization" tab, select "Bearer Token" and paste your access token.
   - Send the request to interact with the GitHub API.

## Example Request in Postman

1. Set up a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/api/dependencies` with the following query parameters:
   - Key: `repoName`, Value: `[your-repo-name]`
   - Key: `owner`, Value: `[repo-owner]`

2. In the "Headers" section, add the following:
   - Key: `Authorization`, Value: `Bearer [your-github-access-token]`

3. Send the request.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the Spring Boot application is running and accessible.
- Confirm that you have correctly set up your GitHub OAuth application and that the `client_id` and `redirect_uri` match what is registered on GitHub.
- If you encounter any issues with the OAuth flow, review the GitHub documentation and ensure that the application's callback URL is correctly configured to handle the OAuth2 callback from GitHub.
