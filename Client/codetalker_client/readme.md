# CodeTalker Client

CodeTalker Client is a React-based application with a focus on providing a modern user interface for web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installing CodeTalker Client

To install CodeTalker Client, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codetalker_client.git

# Navigate to the repository directory
cd codetalker_client

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running Locally

To run CodeTalker Client locally, you'll just need to start the React development server:

```bash
# Start the application in development mode
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Building for Production

If you need to build the app for production, you can use the following command:

```bash

```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```

## Deployment

CodeTalker Client is hosted on Vercel at [https://springboot-code-talker-g88r.vercel.app/](https://springboot-code-talker-g88r.vercel.app/). The deployment process is typically handled through Vercel's CI/CD pipeline, which builds and deploys the app upon each commit to the main branch.

For manual deployments to Vercel, you can use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install the Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy
```
